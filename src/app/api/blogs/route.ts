       {
         heading1: "Introduction",

         paragraph1: "Next.js, the popular React framework, has been evolving rapidly with new features that simplify development and enhance performance. With the release of Next.js 15, developers can now take advantage of several new capabilities that make building modern web applications even more efficient and seamless. Let’s dive into the key features and updates in Next.js 15.",

       /* sub headings start */
       {
         heading: "1. Optimized Image Handling",


         paragraph: "Next.js 15 comes with a major update to image handling. The framework introduces a more powerful and flexible image component, which significantly improves performance. The next/image component now supports a wider range of image formats, including WebP and AVIF. These formats offer better compression and quality, leading to faster load times for users. Additionally, Next.js automatically optimizes images by default, making them more efficient and responsive without extra configuration."
       },
       {
         heading: "2. Middleware Enhancements",
         paragraph: "In Next.js 15, middleware functionality has been enhanced to provide more control over routing and request handling. Middleware can now be used to modify the request/response cycle on a per-page basis or globally across the application. This feature is particularly useful for things like authentication, logging, or redirecting users based on certain conditions. With this update, Next.js takes another step toward making server-side logic easier to implement and more performant."
       },
       {
         heading: "3. Server Components (Experimental)",
         paragraph: "One of the most exciting features in Next.js 15 is the introduction of Server Components (currently experimental). Server Components allow you to build fully server-rendered React components that can be sent to the client without the need for JavaScript execution on the client side. This feature can dramatically reduce the amount of JavaScript sent to the browser, improving load times and overall performance. Though still experimental, this opens up new possibilities for server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG)."
